    <h2>My hobbies</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Playing/Watching Basketball: Imagine bouncing a ball on a court, running around, and trying to score points by
        throwing the ball through a hoop. It’s like a dance with a basketball. My favorite player is <a
          href="https://www.lebronjames.com/">LeBron
          James.</a>

      </li>
      <li>Watching movies: Each film invites us on an emotional rollercoaster. From laughter to tears, suspense to awe,
        movies evoke feelings we might not experience in our everyday lives. Whether it’s a heartwarming romance or an
        adrenaline-pumping thriller, we become part of the story. My all-time favorite movie is <a
          href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/"> The
          Godfather.</a><br>
        <img

          width="400px" height="500px" alt="The Godfather">
      </li>
      <li>Music: Music is like a magical language that everyone understands. Whether you’re playing an instrument or
        singing, it’s a way to express feelings and connect with others. My favorite singer is Marshall Bruce Mathers
        aka Eminem. He received an Oscar for his iconic song "<a href="https://youtu.be/xFYQQPAOz7Y">Lose Yourself</a>".
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Eminem_2021_Color_Corrected.jpg" width="400px"
          height="500px"></img>
      </li>
      <li>Travelling: Think of exploring new places—forests, markets, ancient ruins. Traveling isn’t just about where
        you go; it’s about the people you meet and the stories you collect.</li>
      <li>Melodica: Picture a small keyboard that you play by blowing air into it. It’s like a musical harmonica-piano
        hybrid. Fun fact: You can serenade raindrops with it!</li>
      <li>Podcasts: Imagine having interesting conversations with experts, comedians, or storytellers—except it’s all in
        your ears. Podcasts are like mental adventures. My favorite podcast to listen to is <a
          href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/">Andrew Huberman
          Lab Podcast.</a><br>

    </ol>
    <p>Remember, hobbies add flavor to life. So whether you’re dribbling a ball, humming a tune, or exploring the world,
      enjoy every moment!</p>

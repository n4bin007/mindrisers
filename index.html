    <h2>My hobbies</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Playing/Watching Basketball: Imagine bouncing a ball on a court, running around, and trying to score points by
        throwing the ball through a hoop. It’s like a dance with a basketball. My favorite player is <a
          href="https://www.lebronjames.com/">LeBron
          James.</a> LeBron James, born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, U.S., is an American professional
        basketball player. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest all-around players in the history of the sport.
        LeBron has achieved remarkable milestones throughout his career. In 2023, he became the NBA’s all-time leading
        scorer, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s record. His dominance continued when, in 2024, he reached the
        remarkable milestone of 40,000 points scored.

      </li><br>
      <li>Watching movies: Each film invites us on an emotional rollercoaster. From laughter to tears, suspense to awe,
        movies evoke feelings we might not experience in our everyday lives. Whether it’s a heartwarming romance or an
        adrenaline-pumping thriller, we become part of the story. My all-time favorite movie is <a
          href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/"> The
          Godfather.</a>The Godfather, released in 1972, is an American gangster epic film that has achieved legendary
        status since its debut. Adapted from Mario Puzo’s best-selling novel, it weaves a multigenerational saga within
        the fictional New York Mafia family—the Corleones.<br>

      </li><br>
      <li>Music: Music is like a magical language that everyone understands. Whether you’re playing an instrument or
        singing, it’s a way to express feelings and connect with others. My favorite singer is Eminem. Eminem, born
        Marshall Bruce Mathers III, is an American rapper, record producer, and actor. He is widely regarded as one of
        the greatest and most influential artists of all timeRolling Stone magazine even dubbed him the “King of Hip
        Hop” and included him in their list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". He received an Oscar for his
        iconic song "<a href="https://youtu.be/xFYQQPAOz7Y">Lose Yourself</a>".<br>

      </li><br>
      <li>Travelling: Think of exploring new places—forests, markets, ancient ruins. Traveling isn’t just about where
        you go; it’s about the people you meet and the stories you collect.

      <li>Melodica: Picture a small keyboard that you play by blowing air into it. It’s like a musical harmonica-piano
        hybrid. Fun fact: You can serenade raindrops with it!

      <li>Podcasts: Imagine having interesting conversations with experts, comedians, or storytellers—except it’s all in
        your ears. Podcasts are like mental adventures. My favorite podcast to listen to is <a
